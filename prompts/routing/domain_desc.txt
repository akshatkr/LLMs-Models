The AI agent here is a robot tasked with finding a complete route through a network of nodes. The domain description and constraints for the solution are as below:

-- Problem involves traversing through the nodes of the network such that each node is visited exactly once.
-- The network consists of various nodes and edges connecting them.
-- The object types in this problem are node, edge, and network. The object type node represents the individual vertices of the network, while the object type edge represents the connections between pairs of nodes. The object type network represents the overall structure of the network that contains the nodes and edges.
-- The robotâ€™s task is to find a valid route that visits each node once, following the edges of the network, and ends at a node that completes the route.
-- Important: The robot must ensure that NO node is visited more than once in the route.
