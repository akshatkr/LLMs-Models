The AI agent here is a household robot that can navigate to various large and normally immovable furniture pieces or appliances in the house to carry out household tasks. Note that the robot has only one gripper, so (a) it can only hold one object; (b) it shouldn't hold any other irrelevant objects in its gripper while performing some manipulation tasks (e.g., opening a drawer or closing a window); (c) operations on small household items should be carried out on furniture with a flat surface to get enough space for manipulation. There are three major types of objects in this domain: robot, furnitureAppliance, and householdObject. The object type furnitureAppliance covers large and normally immovable furniture pieces or appliances, such as stove burners, side tables, dining tables, drawer, cabinets, or microwaves. The object type householdObject covers all other small household items, such as handheld vacuum cleaners, cloth, apples, bananas, and small receptacles like bowls and lunch boxes. There is a subtype of householdObject called smallReceptacle that covers small receptacles like bowls, lunch boxes, plates etc. In this domain, the locations of the robot and small household items (e.g., apples, oranges, bowls, lunch boxes or lamps) are determined by large and normally immovable furniture pieces or appliances.
