Okay, here's the PDDL representation of the "move to node" action, based on the provided domain information. I'm focusing on capturing the core constraints and effects.

```pddl
Action: move-to-node

Parameters:
1. ?current_node - node: The node the robot is currently at.
2. ?next_node - node: The node the robot is moving to.

Preconditions:
```
(and
   (connected ?current_node ?next_node)
   (network-contains ?current_node)
   (network-contains ?next_node)
   (not (visited ?next_node))
   (robot-at ?current_node)
)
```

Effects:
```
(and
   (not (robot-at ?current_node))
   (robot-at ?next_node)
   (visited ?next_node)
)
```

New Predicates:
1. (connected ?node1 - node ?node2 - node): true if there is an edge connecting node ?node1 to node ?node2.
2. (network-contains ?node - node): true if the network contains the node ?node.
3. (robot-at ?node - node): true if the robot is currently at the node ?node.
4. (visited ?node - node): true if the node ?node has been visited in the current route.
```

**Explanation and Reasoning:**

*   **`connected ?current_node ?next_node`**: This is a fundamental precondition. The robot can only move if there's a direct connection (edge) between the current node and the target node.
*   **`network-contains ?current_node` and `network-contains ?next_node`**:  Ensures that both the current and next nodes are part of the network.  This prevents the robot from trying to move to nodes outside the defined network.
*   **`not (visited ?next_node)`**: This is crucial for the "visit each node exactly once" constraint. The robot can only move to a node if it hasn't already been visited in the current route.
*   **`robot-at ?current_node`**: The robot must be at the current node to begin moving.
*   **`not (robot-at ?current_node)`**: The robot is no longer at the current node after the move.
*   **`robot-at ?next_node`**: The robot is now at the target node.
*   **`visited ?next_node`**:  The target node is marked as visited.

**Important Considerations and Potential Extensions:**

*   **Route Completion:**  The problem description mentions completing the route.  This would likely require an additional predicate (e.g., `route-complete`) and a condition in the effects of a separate "route-complete" action.
*   **Starting Node:**  You'd likely need a predicate to specify the robot's initial location (e.g., `initial-robot-location ?node`).
*   **Edge Direction:** If edges are directed (one-way), the `connected` predicate would need to reflect that directionality.
*   **Error Handling:**  You might want to add predicates and actions to handle situations where a valid move isn't possible (e.g., a "dead end").
*   **Path Planning:** This action only handles a single move. A more complex system might involve a path planning action that determines a sequence of moves to reach a goal.
