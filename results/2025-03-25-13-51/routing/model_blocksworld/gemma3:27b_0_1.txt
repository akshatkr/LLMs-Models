Action: move_to_node
####################
--------------------
You can create and define new predicates, but you may also reuse the following predicates:
1. (robot-at ?x - node): true if the robot is currently at node ?x
2. (edge-exists ?x - node ?y - node): true if there is an edge connecting node ?x and node ?y
3. (node-unvisited ?x - node): true if node ?x has not been visited yet
4. (node-visited ?x - node): true if node ?x has been visited.
5. (route-completed): true if the route is completed.
6. (node-n1-visited-before-n2): true if node n1 is visited before node n2.
--------------------
--------------------
1. ?x - node: the current node
2. ?y - node: the target node

Preconditions:
```
(and
   (robot-at ?x)
   (edge-exists ?x ?y)
   (node-unvisited ?y)
)
```

Effects:
```
(and
   (not (robot-at ?x))
   (robot-at ?y)
   (not (node-unvisited ?y))
   (node-visited ?y)
)
```
