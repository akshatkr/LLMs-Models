Action: move_to_node
####################
--------------------
You can create and define new predicates, but you may also reuse the following predicates:
No predicate has been defined yet
--------------------
--------------------
1. ?from_node - node: the node the robot is currently at
2. ?to_node - node: the node the robot is moving to

Preconditions:
```
(and
   (robot-at ?from_node)
   (edge-exists ?from_node ?to_node)
   (node-unvisited ?to_node)
)
```

Effects:
```
(and
   (not (robot-at ?from_node))
   (not (node-unvisited ?to_node))
   (robot-at ?to_node)
)
```

New Predicates:
1. (robot-at ?x - node): true if the robot is currently at node ?x
2. (edge-exists ?x - node ?y - node): true if there is an edge connecting node ?x and node ?y
3. (node-unvisited ?x - node): true if node ?x has not been visited yet



####################
Action: visit_node
####################
--------------------
You can create and define new predicates, but you may also reuse the following predicates:
1. (robot-at ?x - node): true if the robot is currently at node ?x
2. (edge-exists ?x - node ?y - node): true if there is an edge connecting node ?x and node ?y
3. (node-unvisited ?x - node): true if node ?x has not been visited yet
--------------------
--------------------
1. ?x - node: the node to visit

Preconditions:
```
(and
   (robot-at ?x)
   (node-unvisited ?x)
)
```

Effects:
```
(and
   (not (node-unvisited ?x))
   (node-visited ?x)
)
```

New Predicates:
1. (node-visited ?x - node): true if node ?x has been visited.


####################
Action: end_route
####################
--------------------
You can create and define new predicates, but you may also reuse the following predicates:
1. (robot-at ?x - node): true if the robot is currently at node ?x
2. (edge-exists ?x - node ?y - node): true if there is an edge connecting node ?x and node ?y
3. (node-unvisited ?x - node): true if node ?x has not been visited yet
4. (node-visited ?x - node): true if node ?x has been visited.
--------------------
--------------------
```
?x - node: the node where the robot completes the route

Preconditions:
```
(and
   (forall (?n - node) (imply (node-unvisited ?n) (not (node-unvisited ?n))))
   (forall (?n - node) (node-visited ?n))
)
```

Effects:
```
(and
   (route-completed)
)
```

New Predicates:
1. (route-completed): true if the route is completed.
```

--------------------
Extracted predicates:

1. (robot-at ?x - node): true if the robot is currently at node ?x
2. (edge-exists ?x - node ?y - node): true if there is an edge connecting node ?x and node ?y
3. (node-unvisited ?x - node): true if node ?x has not been visited yet
4. (node-visited ?x - node): true if node ?x has been visited.
5. (route-completed): true if the route is completed.
